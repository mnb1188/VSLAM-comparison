This repository includes all files connected to bachelor thesis "Analiza porównawcza wybranych otwartoźródłowych algorytmów VSLAM" written by me, as a part of my Electormobility studies.

  <li>SLAM-libs - contains a repository for each of the chosen VSLAM algorithm.</li>
  <li>Tools - contains short python scripts, designed to convert .mp4 file to a dataset, which can be processed by ORB-SLAM3</li>
  <li>Trajectory-files - contains all of the numerical results and trajectories presented in thesis, along with scripts to generate them</li>
</ul>
