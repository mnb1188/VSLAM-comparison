# VSLAM-comparison
This repository includes all files connected to bachelor thesis "Analiza porównawcza wybranych otwartoźródłowych algorytmów VSLAM" written by me, as a part of my Electormobility studies.

## Repository structure
This repository consists of following folders:

<ul>
  <li>Additional-libs - contains all libraries, which were required for chosen SLAM algorithms to work and could not be installed through APT tool on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS. </li>
  <li>SLAM-libs - contains a repository for each of the chosen VSLAM algorithm.</li>
  <li>Tools - contains short python scripts, designed to convert .mp4 file to a dataset, which can be processed by ORB-SLAM3</li>
  <li>Trajectory-files - contains all of the numerical results and trajectories presented in thesis, along with scripts to generate them</li>
</ul>
